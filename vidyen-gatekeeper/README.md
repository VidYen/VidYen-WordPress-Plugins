Lock content behind a crypto Monero web miner

== Description ==

 Monetize site traffic by having your users mine crypto while witholding content until they agree. VidYen Gatekeeper allows you to gate ALL content from user until they consent and agree to your conditions and then you can earn Monero or Monero based crypto currency while they are on your site. This method of not exsposing any miner code until consent should prevent adblockers from disabling miner or AV alerts if using the VidYen WMP servers.

== Installation ==

Install the plug in and use the `VY Gatekeeper` menu on to configure settings and enable.

== Features ==

- Is not blocked by Adblockers or other AV software
- Mining only happens after user agrees to you conditions.
- Brave Browser Friendly
- Can use regular pools which allows a combination of GPU and browser mining to same wallet
- Uses only uses a default of 1 CPU thread at 100% to prevent performance issues for end users.
- Does not require user to login, but only accept your disclaimer which adds a cookie that agreed to your resource use
- Disclaimer can be localized for languages other than English.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Are their plugin fees involved?=

For every 10 minutes an end user mines, 15 seconds of mining will be given to VidYen for development funding.

=I don't like this. Can you change that?=

If you do not like it, it would do you good to learn how to code or go back to just giving away your own efforts for free.

=Are there WMP and pool fees?=

Yes, the WMP servers including VidYen are usually low. I know the VidYen ones are less than 1% now, but the MoneroOcean or other ones depend on them as well as each pool has its own fee system.

=Can I change the amount that is mined?=

No. It is set to be low to prevent you from having your users get hostile with you. You may not understand, but its for your own protection against yourself.

=Can I run backend server?=

Yep, I'd google `NotGiven688` but it may require some learning of Linux.

=Can I use this with VYPS?=

No. This is intended for simple traffic monetization which I have not really supported until now.

=Can you help with my Monero wallet?=

You can ask us on our [discord](https://discord.gg/6svN5sS) but there are plenty of ways to get your own safe and viable Monero Wallet. I would suggest reading the [Monero Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/) for different options.

=Can you help me with a problem or question with MoneroOcean?=

VidYen is not affiliated with MoneroOcean. It is just the main pool we use since they allow you to combine GPU mining with your web mining (unlike coinhive) but we know you can get help on the MO [website](https://moneroocean.stream/#/help/faq) or [their discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/) and they will be glad to help you.

=It doesn't really seem to be mining that much?=

It is, but we kept the defaults low to aid with user experience.
